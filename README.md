# Quantum AI Mini Seminar Series: Exploring the Future of Computing and Artificial Intelligence

Quantum AI is gaining significant attention in both computing and engineering. To foster innovation and collaboration, we are launching a short seminar series, inviting the participation of UMKC SSE researchers and students. The inaugural speaker for the series is Luke Miller, a current PhD student under Dr. Yugi Lee. He will introduce computational theory in quantum computing and explore practical applications such as Quantum Neural Networks (QNN). This seminar series is designed to promote learning, spark innovative ideas, and develop solutions across diverse areas in STEM.

We welcome all to participate and learn alongside us as we explore cutting-edge quantum technologies and their applications!  This seminar series will be held in person in room FH337. Additionally, a Zoom option is available for those who prefer to attend virtually.
